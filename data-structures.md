# Data Structures

## App Shortcut List
This data structure represents a list of shortcuts by url pattern.  It is possible for multiple lists to be loaded at the same time (global vs feature specific), in this case the most specific reference ought to win.  The `events` property should be ordered based on the steps required to activate a particular shortcut.

This structure may need a way to differentiate a set of shortcuts based on another DOM identifier.  The thought behind this is that some apps may not use URLs to differentiate a set of shortcuts. 
```json
{
  "urlPattern": "string|regex",
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "label": "string",
      "events": [{
        "type": "string[KeyboardEvent|Event]",
        "name": "string",
        "options": {}
      }]
    } 
  ]
}
```

## Navigation Map
This data structure serves as a reference to corresponding shortcut map files.  It is generated by taking the url patterns from a collection of shortcut maps and mapping those patterns to the corresponding files.  If there is a collision then the most specific pattern should win.
```json
{
    "string|regex": "string"
}
```

Example:
```json
{
  "http*://sheets.google.com*": "/shortcuts/google-sheets-global.json"
}
```
